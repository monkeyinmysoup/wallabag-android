A Android client to [wallabag](http://wallabag.org) (formerly Poche).

This application is released under GPL.


This app is based on [Erik Pires' fork][0], which adds a lot of major improvements over the [original app][1], with the goal to:

- Add xxhdpi support
- Improve the design a little bit
- Improve the code
- Add support for tagging articles after 'wallabagging' them (much like Pocket does)


This application uses the [SmoothProgressBar][2] library, licensed under the [Beerware][3] license.
