# [Wallabag][] client for Android. 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/monkeyinmysoup/wallabag-android.svg?branch=develop-studio)](https://travis-ci.org/monkeyinmysoup/wallabag-android)

This project is an Android app for reading and submitting articles to Wallabag (formerly Poche).

This app is based on the excellent work of [Erik Pires' fork][0] of the [original app][1], adding:

- a new design (this'll be somewhat of an ongoing thing),
- code clean-up and refactoring to work with Android Studio,
- app thumbnails in the list of articles.

My other goals for this fork are to: 
- improve the code further,
- add support to submit articles to wallabag without being redirected to the website,
- add support for tagging articles after 'wallabagging' them (much like Pocket does),
- improve syncing of read/unread status,
- improve security.

Most of those features are probably dependent on the development of an API in the upcoming version 2 of the [wallabag-v2][] backend as well.
