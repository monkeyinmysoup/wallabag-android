# [Wallabag][] client for Android.

This project is an Android app for reading and submitting articles to Wallabag (formerly Poche).

This app is based on the excellent work of [Erik Pires' fork][0] of the [original app][1], adding:

- a new design (this is somewhat of an ongoing thing),
- code clean-up and refactoring to work with Android Studio,
- app thumbnails in the list of articles.

My other goals for this fork are to: 
- improve the code further,
- add support to submit articles to wallabag without being redirected to the website,
- add support for tagging articles after 'wallabagging' them (much like Pocket does),
- improve syncing of read/unread status.

Most of those features will probably require some changes on the [wallabag][] server as well.
