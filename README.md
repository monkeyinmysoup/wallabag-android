# An Android client for [wallabag](http://wallabag.org) (formerly Poche).

This app is based on [Erik Pires' fork][0], which adds a lot of major improvements over the [original app][1]. My current goal for improving this app further:

- Add xxhdpi graphics
- Improve the design
- Improve the code
- Submit articles to wallabag without being redirected to the website
- Add support for tagging articles after 'wallabagging' them (much like Pocket does)
- Transform it for use in Android Studio
